<div class="markdown">
<p>Between May and June 2016, I worked with
<a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices">ocamlyices2</a>, an OCaml package
that binds to the <a href="https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2">Yices</a> C++ library.
Both projects (as well as many Linux projects) are built using the
&ldquo;Autotools&rdquo; suite.</p>
<p>The Autotools suite includes tools like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autoconf</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake">automake</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">libtool</a>. These tools generate a
bunch of shell scripts and Makefiles using shell scripts and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">M4</a> macro language.
The user of your projects ends up two simple commands to build your
project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">./configure
make
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>Why did I bother with this? As part of my PhD, I worked on a tool,
<a href="https://github.com/touist/touist">touist</a>, which uses SMT solvers like
Yices. The <code>touist</code> CLI was written in OCaml (a popular language among
academics, including my supervisor), which meant I had to go through
hoops to interoperate with C/C++ solvers like Yices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first challenge with ocamlyices2 was the fact that I needed a
statically-linked <code>libyices.a</code>. And since Yices depends on
<a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>, I had to dive deep into Yices2&rsquo;s <code>configure.ac</code>
and find a way to select the static version of GMP.</p>
<p>But building a static library <code>libyices.a</code> was not enough. I was to build
in PIC mode (position-independant code, enabled with <code>-fPIC</code> in gcc). The
position-independant code is required when you want to embed a static
library into a dynamically-linked library. That&rsquo;s due to the fact that
OCaml requires both the <code>.so</code> and <code>.a</code> versions of the &ldquo;stub&rdquo; library (a
stub library is a C library that wraps another C library using OCaml C
primitives). And naturally, Yices&rsquo; build system had not been written to
support building a static PIC <code>libyices.a</code>.</p>
<p>I remember these days as an epic struggle against old build systems. This
experience taught me everything about <code>autoconf</code>, Makefiles,
position-independant code, <code>gcc</code>, <code>ldd</code> and <code>libtool</code>. And in this post, I
want to share these discoveries and how I progressed into contributing to
the <a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices">ocamlyices2</a> project.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram showing the dependencies between libraries. Ocamlyices2
depends on Yices and Yices depends on GMP.</p>

<p>The most important thing about this diagram is that since we need a
PIC-enabled static library <code>libyices.a</code> in order to build the &ldquo;binding
libraries&rdquo;: the shared library <code>yices2.cmxs</code> and the static library
<code>libyices2_stubs.a</code>.</p>
<p>And in order to get this PIC-enabled <code>libyices.a</code>, I needed to make sure
that the GMP library picked by the Yices <code>./configure</code> would be static and
PIC-enabled.</p>
<p>In early 2016, the Yices build system was limited to building a shared
library with no support for cross-compilation (a requirement to build on
Windows) and no support for enforcing PIC in <code>libgmp.a</code> and <code>libyices.a</code>.</p>
<h2 id="yices2--autoconf-an-attempt-at-fixing-a-limited-build-system">Yices2 &amp; autoconf: an attempt at fixing a limited build system</h2>
<p>I remember the warmth that we had in May 2016. My daughter had turned three
and we were still living in a tiny appartment since I was technically still
a student.</p>
<p>My first patch to the ocamlyices2 project took over a month of intense
work. The stake was immense: I aimed at revamping the whole Yices2 build
system. The original build system didn&rsquo;t allow developers to statically
build <code>libyices.a</code>. More generally, it was a pain to work with: most
configuration was happening at <code>./configure</code> time, but a ton of things had
still to be passed at make time (e.g., <code>make VAR=value</code>).</p>
<p>This change
(<a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices2/commit/25f5eb15">25f5eb15</a>)
brought a ton of features. But the most important ones were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Better <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code> experience</strong>. Instead of having some
parts of the build configuration being passed as Makefile variables, I
moved everything to nice flags that you would pass to <code>./configure</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proper PIC support</strong>. Sometimes, Yices&rsquo; <code>./configure</code> would pick up a
<code>libgmp.a</code> that would not be &ldquo;PIC&rdquo;. So I wrote a new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">M4</a> macro,
<code>CSL_CHECK_STATIC_GMP_HAS_PIC</code>, that would do the PIC check using
libtool. For example, the developer would be able to ask for a static
library with PIC support:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">./configure --with-pic --enable-static --disable-shared --with-pic-gmp<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PWD</span>/with-pic/libgmp.a
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static <code>libyices.a</code></strong>. The original build system did not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>libtool</code></strong>. Instead of hand-crafted targets for building the static
&amp; dynamic libraries,  <code>libtool</code> allowed me to build both with very
little effort (at the cost of slightly longer build times). I remember
trying to fiddle with the Makefile to be able to get PIC/non-PIC as well
as dynamic/static <code>.o</code> units. Using <code>libtool</code> made it so easier to build
simultanously the static and dynamic versions of <code>libyices</code>
(<code>libyices.a</code> and <code>libyices.so</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-compilation</strong>. I wanted to be able to release binaries for
Windows users, which meant that I needed to cross-compile from a Cygwin
environment to a Win32 executable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I also fixed weird bugs like a failure on Alpine 3.5 due to a race
condition in <code>ltmain.sh</code>. Yes, you heard well! A race condition in a build
system!</p>
<p>Not sure, but
<a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices2/commit/25f5eb15">25f5eb15</a> might
be my biggest commit ever:</p>

    libyices: build system: moved all config from Makefile to ./configure

    What I tried to fix:
    * Impossible to produces static archive libyices.a for the mingw32 host.
    * So much configuration done in Makefile instead of ./configure.
    * The &#39;make build OPTION= MODE=&#39; is kind of unexpected and not really standard.
    * As an end-user builder, it is hard to guess that my system-installed libgmp.a
      is not PIC. The build system should help me with that.
    * CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS cannot be overritten by the end-user builder at &#39;make&#39;
      time. See &#39;Preset Output Variables&#39; in the autoconf manual.
    * `smt2_commands.c`, `smt2_parser.c` and `smt2_term_stack.c` are all including
      `smt2_commands.h`, and in `smt2_commands.h` there is a definition of a type,
      so there is a clash of symbols at link time. Solution 1: use &#39;extern&#39; in .h
      and definition in .c. Solution 2: typedef the enum.
    * The build system should be fully parallel-proof. Note that &#39;make -j&#39; is a
      thread bomb; prefer using &#39;make -j4&#39; if you have 4 processors.
    * Why removing libyices.a when using &#39;dist&#39;? (rm -f $(distdir)/lib/libyices.a)
      libyices.a should be distributed to the end-users along with the shared lib.
    * Why does libgmp.a contain more than libgmp.so? I guess it is because some
      function are needed by the tests and the tests are never dynamically linked
      to the shared libyices.so... For example, the test `test_type_matching` calls
      a function &#39;delete_pstore&#39; that is not exported. This means we cannot use the
      created libyices.so! We must instead use the object files directly.

    Features of the new build system:
    * It is now possible to select what you want to build using --enable-static
      and --enable-shared. By default, both are built. You can speed up the build
      by disabling one of the modes, for example --disable-shared.
    * Running ./configure will tell you if the libgmp.a found/given with
      --with-static-gmp or --with-pic-gmp is PIC or not.
    * Libtool now handles all shared library naming with version number and symbolic
      links. on linux, .so, on mac os .dylib, on windows .a, .dll.a and .dll...
    * It is now possible to choose if you want PIC-only code in the static
      library libyices.a using --with-pic.
    * The ./configure now configures and the Makefile makes; moved all the
      configuration steps that were done in the Makefile.
    * It is not required anymore to pass OPTION when using make. OPTION is now
      handled by passing for example --host=i686-w64-mingw32 when running
      ./configure, instead of &#39;make OPTION=mingw32&#39;,
    * It is not required anymore to pass MODE in make. MODE is now handled by
      the argument --with-mode=release (for example) when running ./configure.
    * Removed the confusing mess of build/&lt;host&gt;/... and configs/make.&lt;host&gt;.
      Build objects are simply put in build/.
    * Merged the many Makefiles that were sharing a lot of code in common.
    * Standardized the &#39;make&#39; target and experience:
      - make build for building binaries and library (no need for OPTION or MODE)
      - make dist (non-standard) for showing the results of the build as it would
        be distributed
      - make distclean for removing any files created by ./configure
      - make lib if you only want the library
      - make install and uninstall for installing/uninstalling (DESTDIR supported)
    * On Windows, we can now build a static library libyices.a.
    * On Windows, shared and static libraries can be built at once. The static
      version of libyices.a can be renamed using --with-static-name.
    * DESTDIR works as expected: it will reproduce the hierarchy using the prefix
      when running &#39;make install DESTDIR=/path&#39;
    * A nice summary of the configuration is now printed when running ./configure.
      It allows to check if libgmp.a is PIC or not, and helps to have a clear
      view of what is going to happen.
    * Moved version number of Yices in configure.ac
    * If the user wants to use --with-pic-gmp but his libgmp.a is not PIC, give him
      an indication of what command to run to build the with-PIC libgmp.a.
    * Moved the gmaketest into configure; warn the user if &#39;make&#39; is not gnu make.
    * Parallel build is now fully supported (make -j)
    * when using --with-static-gmp (and other similar flags), try to find gmp.h
      in . and ../include automatically, and fall back with the system-wide gmp.h
    * check for gmp.h even when no --with-static-gmp-include-dir is given
    * moved all csl_* functions into autoconf/m4/csl_check_libs.m4 so that they
      can be reused somewhere else
    * compute dependencies only if not in release mode and at compile time
      instead of ahead of time. This saves time during compilation, because deps
      are not necessary if the .c or .h files are not changed (i.e., if the builder
      is the end-user). If the builder is a developer, then he will set
      --with-mode={debug,profile...} and this will trigger the deps to be computed.
    * &#39;make test&#39; compiles and runs all tests in tests/unit
    * &#39;make test_api12&#39; will compile and run the test tests/unit/test_api12.c
    * removed version_*.c file as it is rebuilt at make time
    * gperf is now only necessary when changing the tokens.txt or keywords.txt files,
      the end-user builder does not have to have gperf installed.

    Side notes:
    * CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and any other makefile variable can be overwritten
      using &#39;make LDFLAGS=...&#39; (was already the case with the previous version of the
      build system)

    Known issues:
    * on Mac OS X, linking executables agains non-PIC libgmp.a will throw the
      following warning:
      ld: warning: PIE disabled. Absolute addressing (perhaps -mdynamic-no-pic)
      not allowed in code signed PIE, but used in ___gmpn_mul_1 from libgmp.a(mul_1.o).
      To fix this warning, don&#39;t compile with -mdynamic-no-pic or link with -Wl,-no_pie

    Todo:
    * produce libyices.def on Windows
    * make sure the test on libgmp-10.dll is future-proof (remove the &#39;-10&#39;)
    * fix the &#39;echo summary&#39;
    * I did not test the checks made configure.ac on mcsat and libpoly; we should
      do the same tests as done on libgmp.a (for checking that it is PIC) and
      add a helping message at the end of configure.ac.
    * For the tests, I read that two kind of tests were compiled:
      - &#39;tests&#39; where the tests are linked to the non-PIC libgmp.a and static libgmp.a
      - &#39;tests-static&#39; where the tests are linked to the PIC libgmp.a and shared
        GMP library.
      I changed the second one: it links to the shared version of libyices and shared
      version of GMP. But building the with-PIC libyices.a would be really easy
      (and it is still possible using the flag --with-pic).
    * &#39;make dist&#39; is not a staging area (for now) for &#39;make install&#39;. They both
      install from built objects.
    * it is not possible to compile the tests against the shared library
      because many symbols which are used in the tests are not exported (&#39;export&#39;
      in the C code). They exist if we do &#39;nm&#39; but they are just not usable.

    * pstore issue:

    The visibility is T (visible) in static mode and t (hidden) in shared mode. This
    is because &#39;abstract_values.c&#39; has not been &#39;exported&#39; (=added in `yices_api.c`).
    Here is an example of the difference (functions from )
    ```
    # nm build/lib/libyices.a | grep pstore
    0000000000000090 T _delete_pstore
    0000000000000000 T _init_pstore
    # nm build/lib/.libs/libyices.2.dylib | grep pstore
    0000000000037e10 t _delete_pstore
    0000000000037d80 t _init_pstore
    ```

    I tweaked the ltmain.sh to be able to pass different CPPFLAGS for the compilation
    of static and shared objects by the `%.o: %.c` rule. CPPFLAGS must be different
    because of Windows dlls: `-DNOYICES_DLL -D__GMP_LIBGMP_DLL=0` for example.

    I added two variables LT_STATIC_CFLAGS and LT_SHARED_CFLAGS. They allow me
    to pass CFLAGS to libtool for .c -&gt; .o targets. It allows me to pass things
    like -DYICES_STATIC, -DNOYICES_DLL and -D_LIBGMP_DLL.

</code></pre></div><p>What a massive commit message, right?!</p>
<p>Oviously, I still needed to use all the new features that I had just addeed
to the Yices <code>./configure</code>. So I proposed a second patch
(<a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices2/commit/ccb5a563">ccb5a563</a>) with
changes to the ocamlyices2&rsquo;s own <code>./configure</code>; that took the form of new
flags so that I would be able to build a static <code>libyices.a</code> by specifying
the static version of the GMP library <code>libgmp.a</code>.</p>
<p>I also used the new cross-compilation capability of the Yices <code>./configure</code>
so that it would be possible to build ocamlyices2 on Windows. The
compilation would rely on the POSIX-compliant
<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> suite and cross-compile to a native Win32
executable using <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW32</a> (which a port of GCC).</p>

Commit: 38200b0a

    libyices: added option --without-gmp-embedded

    This option will disable the partial linking that allows to embed
    GMP into libyices.a (only with --enable-static).

    For example, on Arch linux, the partial linking command

        ld -r -lgmp *.o -o libyices.o

    would fail even if libgmp.so is correclty installed. It seems that &#39;ld -r&#39;
    would only work with a static libgmp.a (but the arch linux repo only installs
    the shared gmp library).

    Why this `ld -r`? This command is the only way I found to compile a
    static libyices.a from either a shared or a static libgmp and produce
    a gmp-depend-free libyices.a.

    Two solutions:

    1. Drop the necessity for building a libyices.a free of gmp dependency.
       In this case, I could remove the `ld -r`.
       It would then create a libyices.a that depends on libgmp.a/so.
    2. Separate the gmp-dependency-free libyices.a from the normal
       gmp-dependent libyices.a. For example, I could use the option
       `--without-gmp-embedded`

    So I went with solution (2).

    This option disables the embedding of GMP inside libyices.a. This
    &#39;embedding&#39; is made using partial linking (ld -r) which seems to
    be failing on Arch Linux when using the shared GMP library.

make sure that the user-provided libgmp was PIC when using <code>--with-pic</code>, I

    libyices: with --enable-static and --with-pic, enforce PIC libgmp.a

    One problem I came across was that most of the time, when I was doing

        ./configure --enable-static --with-pic

    the produced libyices.a would still contain non-PIC libgmp.a, although
    being itself PIC. In this commit, I enforce that if --with-pic is given,
    then:

    1) either --with-pic-gmp has been given, in this case we use that for
       creating the PIC libyices.a;
    2) or --with-pic-gmp has not been given and thus we try to simply use the
       shared gmp through -lgmp.

    Reminder: we also check that the system libgmp.a or the libgmp.a given with
    --with-static-gmp is PIC. If it is the case, the PIC libgmp.a will be used
    for --with-pic.
</code></pre></div><p>Now, I also had to fix ocamlyices2&rsquo;s <code>./configure</code> since <code>ld -r</code> (partial
linking) was not supported on Arch Linux (see [PR&rsquo;s CI failure](pull

    ocamlyices2: use --without-gmp-embedded by default

    After giving it some thoughts, the need for having a self-contained libyices.a
    (which would only need -lyices, no -lgmp needed) in ocamlyices2 is pointless
    as &#39;zarith&#39; will still need &#39;-lgmp&#39; anyway.

    The Makefile will still put libgmp.a and libyices.a inside src/ so that
    the static version of gmp is used (with -L.) instead of the shared version.

    Rationale: disabling the partial linking fixes the build on Arch Linux, which
    (I re-tested on a docker image) cannot accept partial linking with -lgmp when
    only libgmp.so is available. Here is the failing command:

        ld -r *.o -lgmp -o libyices.o
</code></pre></div><h2 id="final-result-of-the-yices2-build-system">Final result of the Yices2 build system</h2>
<p>The experience with the re-written <code>./configure</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices2/tree/master/ext/yices">here</a>) is
very different from the original one. When the user wants to compile the
library with PIC, they get a warning if one of the dependencies is not PIC.
There is a much finer control over what the user wants: dynamic vs. static,
PIC vs. non-PIC. But also more control over dependencies like GMP, since
the user must be able to pass a static or dynamic version of libgmp.</p>
<p>The <code>./configure</code> that you can see
<a href="https://github.com/polazarus/ocamlyices2/tree/master/ext/yices">here</a>
gained many features like <code>--with-shared-gmp</code> or <code>--with-pic</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>A final word about the <code>Makefile</code>: since all the build configuration is
handled by <code>./configure</code>, you don&rsquo;t have to pass any variables at <code>make</code>
time anymore, which really helps when you need to <code>make</code> multiple times in
a row and don&rsquo;t want to type the variables every single time.</p>
<h2 id="inpecting-static-and-dynamic-libraries">Inpecting static and dynamic libraries</h2>
<p>Here are two tips that I learned along the way. First, I very often need to
know what libraries an executable is depending on:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I also had to dig into the symbols of libraries in order to make sure that
static libraries contained all the needed symbols:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The letter before the symbol is the &ldquo;symbol type&rdquo; (from <code>man nm</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if undefined). This
value is followed by one of the following characters, representing the
symbol type:</p>
<ul>
<li>U = undefined,</li>
<li>T (text section symbol),</li>
<li>D (data section symbol),</li>
<li>S (symbol in a section other than those above).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the symbol is local (non-external), the symbol&rsquo;s type is instead
represented by the corresponding lowercase letter. A lower case u in a
dynamic shared library indicates a undefined reference to a private
external in another module in the same library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the symbol <code>_yices_parse_float</code> is an external symbol, meaning
that this symbol isn&rsquo;t static to <code>libyices.a</code>. On the other side,
<code>_convert_simple_value</code> is statically defined (<code>t</code>).</p>
<h2 id="contributing-the-new-yices-build-system-to-upstream">Contributing the new Yices build system to upstream</h2>
<p>On 16 June 2016, I sent an email to Bruno Dutertre, one of the developers
at SRI (the company behind the Yices SMT solver). I proposed all these
changes with links to the various patches on GitHub. Unfortunately, it
didn&rsquo;t work out, and the reason might be that the whole patch was enormous
and very hard to review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi MaÃ«l,</p>
<p>Thanks for the message and for your efforts. We&rsquo;ll look into your updates.</p>
<p>We know that the Yices build system is unconventional because most of the
work is done in the Makefiles rather that in the configure script. There
are historical reason for this (and it should be able to build PIC
libraries without problems).</p>
<p>By the way, Yices is now open-source (GPL) on github:
<a href="https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2">https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2</a>. Take a look when you have time,</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Bruno</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish we had a unit-test framework for <code>autoconf</code>. The <code>autoconf</code>
ecosystem generates very fragile scripts and the only way to test them is
to run them with all possible flag combinations, which is pretty much
impossible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update 31 May 2020</strong>: added the ascii &ldquo;dependency&rdquo; diagram to give a
better sense of what the challenge was.</li>
