## About me -- looking for opportunities (startup only)

> **Note:** if you want the most up-to-date information about me, I
> recommend taking a look at my [LinkedIn][] page.

- I speak and write English fluently (learnt a lot during my PhD). Come try
  my delicious and refreshing french-flavoured accent! ðŸ˜„
- I enjoy contributing to open-source projects; when I do, it is mostly a way of
  scratching a developer itch on one of my tools. I sent pull requests
  toÂ [ocaml-minisat][],Â [ocaml-qbf][]Â andÂ [opam][] (OCaml),Â [gitlab-ce][]Â (Ruby on
  rails, Rspec),Â [boost-graph][] (C++). I also maintainÂ [homebrew-amc][]Â (Ruby,
  Travis CI),Â [touist][] (OCaml) and fourÂ [vscode-extensions][] (they use
  Typescript; one of them has 29k download! ðŸ˜Š). To me, open-source promotes
  tolerance when it comes to discuss and accept other's patches as well as
  leading people to give friendly and constructive critics (most of the time
  though; mileage may vary).
- I love functional programming; I have 3 years of experience using OCaml
  building a compiler and solver for propositional logic. I also did some
  ReasonML. I discovered Elixir and Erlang a couple of days ago and so far, I
  love it. Still a lot to learn though, but I start to get the hang of it.
- I am very interested by micro-service architectures; I did some side-projects
  using Go, gRPC (e.g. [maelvls/quote][]) with Kubernetes. I had a lot of fun
  with it (mostly thanks to Go's excellent 'dev experience'). I also played with
  Elixir which also benefits from a very polished 'dev experience'.
- Throughout my work, I like to improve the 'developer experience' (DX) by
  improving the tooling as well as the overall DevOps workflow. I think that a
  good developer experience keeps retaining and gaining good developers. If
  given the opportunity, I wish to contribute in that regard.
- I worked with multiple automation and continuous integration tools (Drone.io,
  Travis CI, Gitlab CI, Circle CI and Appveyor; pull request lifecycle using
  bots and Slack ChatOps integration with Slack). On the CI/CD side, I also
  collaborated with the Homebrew 'tap' people:Â [How to automate the build of
  bottles on your Homebrew tap][homebrew-tap-auto-bottles].
- I experimented with Docker, Kubernetes using Terraform, Helm, Traefik and
  Prometheus/Grafana; both on AWS EKS and GCP GKE
  (seeÂ [maelvls/awx-gke-terraform][]Â andÂ [maelvls/terraform-touist][]).
- I have some knowledge on machine learning (more specifically, deep learning)
  as it was one of the topics during the first 6 months of my PhD (see
  myÂ [masters-thesis][]).
- I can bring some knowledge about routing problems, more specifically shortest
  path algorithms. During an internship at Mobigis, I developed a shortest-path
  algorithm based on Dijkstra for carpooling on actual geographic data; I also
  contributed to the open-source [boost-graph][] library (mainly written in
  C++11). I also worked on vehicle routing ([vehicule-routing-report][]Â in
  French).
- On the teamwork side, I worked in various project agile setups (Scrum and
  Kanban) in teams ranging from 2 to 6 people.
- As a last note, I really think pair-programming and code reviews can make us
  developers grow and learn from others, not only about code but also finding
  the best tooling and shortcuts (Emacs, IDEs, command line tools...) and such.

Administrative details:

- I am available for hire starting on (around) July 15th, 2019.
- I am available for interviews or technical assessments every week day after
  6pm or on Saturdays.
- On the matter of compensation, 2500 euros per month would fit me perfectly
  (net salary including everything like bonuses or things alike), depending on
  the job attractiveness (e.g. technologies, remote possibilities, possibility
  to attend to tech conferences...)

## Past Experiences

I am currently employed by [SQUAD] and am currently contracted to La Banque
Postale (Toulouse, France). I work on tools for network administrators,
including a web front-end to Ansible Tower APIs.

Before that, I was contracted to Orange, where I worked on tools for
developers, examples and documentation in order to improve the developer
experience when it comes to using the Orange IT's private cloud. I also try
to promote and find new ways to guide people into sharing their own code as
well getting the most out of Orange's internal GitLab.

On April, 10th 2019, I defended my PhD thesis at [IRIT] \(Institut de
Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse, France â€“ [location]) in the [LILaC]
and [ADRIA] team. My PhD work was supervised by Olivier Gasquet (IRIT),
Dominique Longin (CNRS), FrÃ©dÃ©ric Maris (IRIT) and Andreas Herzig (CNRS).
My goal was to develop a tool and a language, [TouIST] \(pronounced
_twist_, standing for _Toulouse Integrated Satisfiability Tool_\), that
will allow us to express and solve real-world problems through the use of
multiple logic theories: SAT, SMT and QBF for now.

[^touist-meaning]:

  _**Tou**louse **i**ntegrated **s**atisfiability **t**ool_.
  it is prononced _twist_. we were looking for a memorable and
  pronounceable name that had no homonym on google. and it
  had to sound like fun, too!
