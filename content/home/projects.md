### Minor contributions to open-source software

- [boost graph] is a part of the large Boost C++ library. I mainly contributed
  through [bug fixes][boost-contributions] to max flow algorithms.
- [gitlab] is a competitor to Github; I proposed multiple
  [bug fixes][gitlab-contribution] (as merge requests) to enhance the
  referencing behavior in issue tickets.
