I am a teaching instructor for the following courses at University Toulouse 3:

2016 (Université Toulouse 3 - Paul Sabatier)

- _Algorithms 1_ (L1, all students): learn the basics of
  algorithmics using a simple programmning language (python) during 14
  hours of practical work. I "taught" this course to chemists, physicists,
  mathematicians and computer scientists. Total: 42h.
- _Logic 1_ (L2, Computer Science students): during 6 hours of pratical
  work, the students learn how to solve problems using propositional logic
  using [TouIST](https://www.irit.fr/touist). Total: 12h.
- _System 1_ (L2, Computer Science students): during 12h of practical work,
  the students learn how to use and script using the Bourne Shell as well as
  many standard GNU/Linux utilities.

2017 (Université Toulouse 3 - Paul Sabatier)

- _Algorithms 1_ (L1, students of _parcours speciaux_): same as previous year.
- _Language theory and compilation_ (M1, Computer Science students): in
  this really dense 8-hours pratical work, students must implement a
  compiler for the [Karel language][karel] in OCaml, using the ocamlyacc or
  menhir parser generator that compiles to something close to assembly
  (_quadruplets_). As languages and compilers are the basis of any
  developper, this practical session give the students a good insight to
  the problems and complexity of any programming language. Total: 12h.
- _Advanced Algorithms_ (M1, Computer Science students): in this 6-hours
  long practical work, the students design, implement and prove the
  complexity of alternate versions of well-known algorithms (binary heap,
  quick sort); students are also shown linear programming, flow algorithms as
  well as global optimization. Total: 12h.

2018 (Université Toulouse 3 - Paul Sabatier)

- _Logique 1_ (L1, Physics students): 7 lectures of 2h for ~30 students
  where I introduce and play with propositional logic (each lecture is
  composed of 1h of tutorial). [Moodle](http://moodle.univ-tlse3.fr/course/view.php?id=2830),
  [slides](https://cloud.irit.fr/index.php/s/emqXmBZtoUW5kVT),
  [exercices on modeling and semantic satisfiability](https://cloud.irit.fr/index.php/s/HU4oQU8VZqX4IRv)
