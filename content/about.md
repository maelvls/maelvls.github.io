I currently work for [Ori](https://www.ori.co/). Ori is a cloud
infrastructure startup that aims at providing a unified experience for
deploying to the edge. I mostly write Go, Kubernetes controllers and CRDs.

I completed my PhD in logic and artificial intelligence in 2019
([papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0BrmuaAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).
