I currently work at [Ori](https://www.ori.co/), a Cloud infrastructure
startup that aims at providing a unified experience for deploying to
close-to-the-user compute resources.

I mostly write Go, Kubernetes controllers and network-related components. I
like details.

I completed a PhD in logic in 2019
([papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0BrmuaAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).
