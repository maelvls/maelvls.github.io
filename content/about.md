Hi! My name is Maël, I am a software engineer based in [Toulouse,
France](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toulouse/@46.6763781,0.1867932,5.46z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aebb6fec7552ff:0x406f69c2f411030!8m2!3d43.604652!4d1.444209). I mostly write Go, Kubernetes controllers and network-related components. I
like details.

I currently work on
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager), an open-souce
CNCF incubated x509 lifecycle manager that
[Jetstack](https://www.jetstack.io/) is maintaining. See my resume at
<https://github.com/maelvls>.

Previously: [Ori Industries](https://www.ori.co/).

I completed a PhD in logic in 2019
([papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0BrmuaAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).
