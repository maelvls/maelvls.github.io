  SAT provers are powerful tools for solving real-sized logic problems, but
  using them requires solid programming knowledge and may be seen w.r.t. logic
  like assembly language w.r.t. programming. Something like a high level
  language was missing to ease various users to take benefit of these tools.
  TouIST aims at filling this gap. It is devoted to propositional logic and its
  main features are 1) to offer a high-level logic langage for expressing
  succintly complex formulas (e.g. formulas describing Sudoku rules,
  planification problems, ...) and 2) to find models to these formulas by using
  the adequate powerful prover, which the user has no need to know about. It
  consists in a friendly interface that offers several syntactic facilities and
  which is connected with some sufficiently powerful provers allowing to
  automatically solve big instances of difficult problems (such as time-tables
  or Sudokus). It can interact with various provers: pure SAT solver but also
  SMT provers (SAT modulo theories - like linear theory of reals, etc) and thus
  may also be used by beginners for experiencing with pure propositional
  problems up to graduate students or even researchers for solving planification
  problems involving big sets of fluents and numerical constraints on them.
