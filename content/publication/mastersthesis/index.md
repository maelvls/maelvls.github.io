  Optimization of Dictionaries Structured as Convolutional Trees for Sparse
  Image Representation - Master’s Thesis
authors:
  - Maël Valais
abstract: >-
  This master’s thesis presents the algorithm OMP-PALMTREE for training fast
  dictionaries based on the convolutional tree model. Inspired by the
  construction of supports in OMP, this algorithm enhances PALMTREE by learning
  the supports (instead of fixing them). The  support adding step, as for OMP,
  is based on the maximum value of the gradient – which is shown to provide
  convincing indications on the best element that should be added. OMP-PALMTREE
  constitutes the “dictionary update” step in a standard dictionary learning
  algorithm, and must be associated with a “sparse coding” step (yet to be
  developed) for it to be used in applications like denoising or image
  recognition. Thanks to the convolutional tree model, dictionaries learned
  using OMP-PALMTREE are faster than dictionaries learned using a standard
  matrix-vector product (which yields quadratic computational cost), with a
  linear computational cost with respect to the size of the image.
