abstract = "SAT provers are powerful tools for solving real-sized logic problems, but using them requires solid programming knowledge and may be seen w.r.t. logic like assembly language w.r.t. programming. Something like a high level language was missing to ease various users to take benefit of these tools. TouIST aims at filling this gap. It is devoted to propositional logic and its main features are 1) to offer a high-level logic langage for expressing succintly complex formulas (e.g. formulas describing Sudoku rules, planification problems, ...) and 2) to find models to these formulas by using the adequate powerful prover, which the user has no need to know about. It consists in a friendly interface that offers several syntactic facilities and which is connected with some sufficiently powerful provers allowing to automatically solve big instances of difficult problems (such as time-tables or Sudokus). It can interact with various provers: pure SAT solver but also SMT provers (SAT modulo theories - like linear theory of reals, etc) and thus may also be used by beginners for experiencing with pure propositional problems up to graduate students or even researchers for solving planification problems involving big sets of fluents and numerical constraints on them."
