Here is my current setup:

![My home office in 2020](mael-home-office-desk-2020.jpg)

- [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti) USB microphone
  > Why a standalone mic just for Zoom? One very important aspect of the
  > remote-only work setup is the importance of being properly understood.
  > I take this very seriously and think that the sound quality of the mic
  > I use every day influences how effective my meetings are. I also make a
  > number of calls to potential candidates, which means I should sound
  > perfect.
- [Yeti Compass](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass) boom arm
  > Note that the boom arm is meant to carry the shock mount + the mic and
  > since I only mounted the Yeti mic, the spring mechanism is a bit too
  > tight which means the arm tends to go up. I unscrewed the screw in the
  > base of the boom arm at its minimum but the tension is still too high
  > and the boom arm tends to go up.
- Some random chair (I wish I could afford the Herman Miller Aeron)
- Apple Magic Keyboard. I also use a [Sharkoon PureWriter
  TKL](https://fr.sharkoon.com/product/PureWriter%20TKL) from time to time
  when I want to bother my collegues with the clank-clank sound of the red
  switches
- [Logitech MX
  Master](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Master-Wireless-Bluetooth-Windows/dp/B00ULNAOMA)
  Just an excellent mouse
- [LG 27UL850-W 27 inches 4K monitor](https://www.amazon.com/LG-27UL850-W-Display-DisplayHDR-Connectivity/dp/B07MKT1W65/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
- [Griffin Elevator stand](https://griffintechnology.com/products/stands-and-mounts/elevator)
- AUKEY mousepad XXL
- USB-C hub Ugreen and AUKEY USB3 hub
- The [Flexispot standing desk
  E5B](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FlexiSpot-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Automatic/dp/B071G2NSRP/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=flexispot%2BE5B&qid=1563776981&s=electronics&sr=8-1-fkmr0&th=1)
  (B = black) with a â‚¬25 wood board I mounted on top.
- (old 2019 setup) [Logitech K760](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Solar-Kebyoard-iPhone/dp/B007VL8Y2C) (wireless solar keyboard)
- (old 2019 setup) Logitech M90 mouse (cheap â‚¬6 mouse)


<!--
## Cool software stuff

- USB overdrive (the default macOS mouse acceleration drives me crazy; also
  allows me to invert up/down scolling for the mouse only; I keep "natural
  scrolling" turned on in the system settings)
- HyperSwitch for switching between windows with <kbd>alt+tab</kbd> (<kbd>cmd+tab</kbd> only allows to switch between apps)
- iTerm 2 + zsh + antigen + async prompt theme (agkozak-zsh-prompt) + tons
  of stuff around command line

And finally, here is a picture from the backyard. ðŸ™‚
