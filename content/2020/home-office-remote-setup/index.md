In 2019, my desk looked like this:

![My home office in 2019](home-office-2019.jpg)

Today, here it is:

- [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti) mic,
- [Yeti Compass](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass) boom arm,
- Some random chair (I wish I could afford the Herman Miller Aeron),
- A [Flexispot E5B standing
  desk](http://uk.flexispot.com/height-adjustable-desks/3-stage-desk-frame-e5.html)
  (I bought the table top separately)
- Apple Magic Keyboard. I also use a [Sharkoon PureWriter
  TKL](https://fr.sharkoon.com/product/PureWriter%20TKL) from time to time
  when I want to bother my collegues with the clank-clank sound of the red
  switches.

## Mic and video setup

One very important aspect of the remote-only work
setup is the importance of being understood properly. I take this very
seriously and think that the sound quality of the mic I use every day
influences how effective my meetings are. I also make a number of calls to
potential candidates, which means I should sound perfect.
