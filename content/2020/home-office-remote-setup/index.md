In 2019, my desk looked like this:

![My home office in 2019](home-office-2019.jpg)

Today, here it is:

- [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti) mic,
- [Yeti Compass](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass) boom arm,
- Some random chair (I wish I could afford the Herman Miller Aeron),
- A [Flexispot E5B standing
  desk](http://uk.flexispot.com/height-adjustable-desks/3-stage-desk-frame-e5.html)
  (I bought the table top separately)
- Apple Magic Keyboard. I also use a [Sharkoon PureWriter
  TKL](https://fr.sharkoon.com/product/PureWriter%20TKL) from time to time
  when I want to bother my collegues with the clank-clank sound of the red
  switches.

- [Flexispot standing desk E5B](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FlexiSpot-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Automatic/dp/B071G2NSRP/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=flexispot%2BE5B&qid=1563776981&s=electronics&sr=8-1-fkmr0&th=1) (B = black) with a €25 wood board I mounted on top
- [LG 27UL850-W 27 inches 4K monitor](https://www.amazon.com/LG-27UL850-W-Display-DisplayHDR-Connectivity/dp/B07MKT1W65/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
- [Logitech K760](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Solar-Kebyoard-iPhone/dp/B007VL8Y2C) (wireless solar keyboard)
- Logitech M90 mouse (cheap €6 mouse)
- [Griffin Elevator stand](https://griffintechnology.com/products/stands-and-mounts/elevator)
- AUKEY mousepad XXL
- USB-C hub Ugreen 


## Mic and video setup

One very important aspect of the remote-only work
setup is the importance of being understood properly. I take this very
seriously and think that the sound quality of the mic I use every day
influences how effective my meetings are. I also make a number of calls to
potential candidates, which means I should sound perfect.

## Cool software stuff

- USB overdrive (the default macOS mouse acceleration drives me crazy; also
  allows me to invert up/down scolling for the mouse only; I keep "natural
  scrolling" turned on in the system settings)
- HyperSwitch for switching between windows with <kbd>alt+tab</kbd> (<kbd>cmd+tab</kbd> only allows to switch between apps)
- iTerm 2 + zsh + antigen + async prompt theme (agkozak-zsh-prompt) + tons
  of stuff around command line
