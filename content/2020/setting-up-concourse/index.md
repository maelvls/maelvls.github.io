```sh
# Make sure I use the same version as the server.
% fly -t main sync

# Login.
% fly login -t main -c https://concourse.k.maelvls.dev/
logging in to team 'main'

navigate to the following URL in your browser:

  https://concourse.k.maelvls.dev/login?fly_port=53932

or enter token manually:
target saved
```

Can `-t main` be remembered by default like contexts and namespaces with
`kubectl config set-context`? See:
- [issue 213](https://github.com/concourse/fly/issues/213):
-
- [issue 1933](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1933):
  > Could `fly` remember the target? Either with `FLY_TARGET` env var or
  > setting a default in ~/.flyrc?
  >
  > Response: The `-t` flag is intentionally stateless and must be
  > explicitly added to each command. This reduces the risk of accidentally

OK. I hate that kind of stubborness.

% cat <<EOF > pipeline.yml
