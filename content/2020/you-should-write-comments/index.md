Before:

Set the Ready condition to False when a CertificateRequest has been denied for all CertificateRequests that reference a cert-manager.io signer ([#3892](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3892), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

After:
Fixes a regression that was introduced in v1.3. Before v1.3, a CertificateRequest that would fail would have the condition `Ready=False` added to it. After v1.3, the `Ready=False` was not set anymore due to the addition of the Approval API. ([#3892](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3892), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

In his book _[Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/)_, Robert C. Martin makes a strong case against comments:

> You don't need comments if you write clean code.

This short sentence seems to have created a "no comment" movement; on [stackoverflow](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1/comments-are-a-code-smell), we can read that comments are a "code smell", that they are adding "noise" and are often out of sync with the code. This movement seems to have grown from the misinterpration of Robert's sentence, which started as a way of saying that some comments (the "what", as we will see below), are not useful to the reader. To some extent, the sentence has become:

> If you write any kind of comment, it means you code isn't clean.

This "no comment" trend is worrying. Without comments, developers have no way to express the "why" in their code logic. In this article, using four different examples, I will show what good comments look like, and how to refactor "what" comments into useful "why" comments.

## Refactoring comments: from the "what" to the "why"

We usually write comments as a way to guide our mind through the intense process of writing code. These "initial comments" often serve as a to-do list, and naturally reflect the way we program. "Initial comments" often start with "if" and are focused on the "what". The concerning part about these "initial comments" is that they often end up commited as-is.

### Code example 1

First, let's dig into the difference between the "why" and the "what" with an example taken from the [Google's Technical Writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two/code-comments) book. In this code snippet, the developer wants to randomly shuffle a slice of integers:

```go
func Shuffle(slice []int) {
  curIndex := len(slice)

    // If the current index is 0, return directly.
    if (curIndex == 0) {
        return
    }

    ...
}
```

The only comment in this snippet focuses on the "what": it paraphrases the code that immediately follows. The comment does not help the reader since the logic itself is trivial. Refactoring this comment consists in moving away from the "what" and focusing on the "why":

```go
func Shuffle(slice []int) {
  curIndex := len(slice)

      // No need to shuffle an array with zero elements.
    if (curIndex == 0) {
      return
    }

    ...
}
```

The "why" brings more value to the reader because the first instinctive question the reader would have:

> Why on earth are we returning now?

Starting comments with the "why" helps glanceability: the reader only needs to read the first few words to get the idea. Here is how I would diffenciate the "why" from the "what":

| Content in a comment | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| The "why"            | Helps you understand how this piece of code came to life. |
| The "what"           | Paraphrases what code does in a human-readable format.\*  |

\*sometimes, commenting on the "what" can still be valuable for readability purposes. I see three reasons to comment on the "what":

1. When the code is not self-explanatory, a "what" comment may avoid the reader the struggle of googling;
2. When a block of code is lenghy, adding "what" comments may help create "sections", helping the reader quicly find the part they are interested in.

### Code example 2

The next example [comes](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3872) from cert-manager. The original comment focuses on the "what":

```go
// If the certificate request has been denied, set the last failure time to
// now, and set the Issuing status condition to False with reason. We only
// perform this check if the request also doesn't have a Ready condition,
// since some issuers may not honor a Denied condition, and will sign and
// set the Ready condition to True anyway. We would still want to complete
// issuance for requests where the issuer doesn't respect approval.
cond := apiutil.GetCertificateRequestCondition(req, cmapi.CertificateRequestConditionReady)
if cond == nil {
    if apiutil.CertificateRequestIsDenied(req) {
        return c.failIssueCertificate(ctx, log, crt, apiutil.GetCertificateRequestCondition(req, cmapi.CertificateRequestConditionDenied))
    }
    return nil
}
```

The first few words are paraphrasing what the code does, and the "why" is buried at the 6th line. We often naturally end up with this form of comment while programming: it helps us lay out the logic.

To refactor this comment, we want to enphasise on the "why". Notice that the "what" has not totally disappeared, but has been moved to the end of the comment. In this example, the code itself is not trivial due to the nesting of two conditions:

```go
// Some issuers won't honor the "Denied=True" condition, and we don't want
// to break these issuers. To avoid breaking these issuers, we skip bubbling
// up the "Denied=True" condition from the certificate request object to the
// certificate object when the issuer ignores the "Denied" state.
//
// To know whether or not an issuer ignores the "Denied" state, we pay
// attention to the "Ready" condition on the certificate request. If a
// certificate request is "Denied=True" and that the issuer still proceeds
// to adding the "Ready" condition (to either true or false), then we
// consider that this issuer has ignored the "Denied" state.
cond := apiutil.GetCertificateRequestCondition(req, cmapi.CertificateRequestConditionReady)
if cond == nil {
    if apiutil.CertificateRequestIsDenied(req) {
        return c.failIssueCertificate(ctx, log, crt, apiutil.GetCertificateRequestCondition(req, cmapi.CertificateRequestConditionDenied))
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Code example 3

The next [example](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/1dad685e/pkg/controller/ingress-shim/sync.go#L145) comes from another part of the cert-manager codebase:

```go
errs := validateIngressTLSBlock(tls)
// if this tls entry is invalid, record an error event on Ingress object and continue to the next tls entry
if len(errs) > 0 {
    errMsg := utilerrors.NewAggregate(errs).Error()
    c.recorder.Eventf(ing, corev1.EventTypeWarning, "BadConfig", fmt.Sprintf("TLS entry %d is invalid: %s", i, errMsg))
    continue
}
```

Let's refactor the comment by focusing on the "why":

```go
// Let the user know that an TLS entry has been skipped due to being invalid.
errs := validateIngressTLSBlock(tls)
if len(errs) > 0 {
    errMsg := utilerrors.NewAggregate(errs).Error()
    c.recorder.Eventf(ing, corev1.EventTypeWarning, "BadConfig", fmt.Sprintf("TLS entry %d is invalid: %s", i, errMsg))
    continue
}
```

### Code example 4

The next example [comes](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/1dad685e4/pkg/controller/ingress-shim/sync.go#L180-L209) from the same file as the previous example:

```go
// check if a Certificate for this TLS entry already exists, and if it
// does then skip this entry
if existingCrt != nil {
    log := logs.WithRelatedResource(log, existingCrt)
    log.V(logf.DebugLevel).Info("certificate already exists for ingress resource, ensuring it is up to date")

    if metav1.GetControllerOf(existingCrt) == nil {
        log.V(logf.InfoLevel).Info("certificate resource has no owner. refusing to update non-owned certificate resource for ingress")
        continue
    }

    if !metav1.IsControlledBy(existingCrt, ing) {
        log.V(logf.InfoLevel).Info("certificate resource is not owned by this ingress. refusing to update non-owned certificate resource for ingress")
        continue
    }

    if !certNeedsUpdate(existingCrt, crt) {
        log.V(logf.DebugLevel).Info("certificate resource is already up to date for ingress")
        continue
    }

    updateCrt := existingCrt.DeepCopy()

    updateCrt.Spec = crt.Spec
    updateCrt.Labels = crt.Labels
    setIssuerSpecificConfig(updateCrt, ing)
    updateCrts = append(updateCrts, updateCrt)
} else {
    newCrts = append(newCrts, crt)
}
```

As in the previous examples, refactoring this example is about moving the "why" to the start of the comment:

```go
// The "secretName" field may already refer to an existing Certificate object.
// We still want this existing Certificate to be .
//
// For example, imagine that the certificate named "example-tls" already exists.
//
//     kind: Ingress
//     spec:
//       tls:
//         - secretName: example-tls
//           hosts: [example.com]
//
if existingCrt != nil {
    log := logs.WithRelatedResource(log, existingCrt)
    log.V(logf.DebugLevel).Info("certificate already exists for ingress resource, ensuring it is up to date")

    if metav1.GetControllerOf(existingCrt) == nil {
        log.V(logf.InfoLevel).Info("certificate resource has no owner. refusing to update non-owned certificate resource for ingress")
        continue
    }

    if !metav1.IsControlledBy(existingCrt, ing) {
        log.V(logf.InfoLevel).Info("certificate resource is not owned by this ingress. refusing to update non-owned certificate resource for ingress")
        continue
    }

    if !certNeedsUpdate(existingCrt, crt) {
        log.V(logf.DebugLevel).Info("certificate resource is already up to date for ingress")
        continue
    }

    updateCrt := existingCrt.DeepCopy()

    updateCrt.Spec = crt.Spec
    updateCrt.Labels = crt.Labels
    setIssuerSpecificConfig(updateCrt, ing)
    updateCrts = append(updateCrts, updateCrt)
}

newCrts = append(newCrts, crt)
```

Note that I removed the `else` statement for the purpose of readability. Since "creating a certificate" seems to be the happy path of this function, it makes sense to unindent the code that relates to this happy path.

<!--
### Code example 5

Let us study a case of lack of comments in the same file as above. The following [snippet](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/1dad685e/pkg/controller/ingress-shim/sync.go#L84-L90) does an update of a Certificate object, but this object does not seem to have been changed:

```go
for _, crt := range updateCrts {
    _, err := c.cmClient.CertmanagerV1().Certificates(crt.Namespace).Update(ctx, crt, metav1.UpdateOptions{})
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    c.recorder.Eventf(ing, corev1.EventTypeNormal, "UpdateCertificate", "Successfully updated Certificate %q", crt.Name)
}
```

From my experience, we often do this when we want to trigger a re-sync of the object, so that's my hypothesis on the "what". But I have no idea "why": why do we need to re-sync the Certificate immediately? What change are we expecting to happen when we do?

A comment would have helped me realize that

```go
for _, crt := range updateCrts {
    _, err := c.cmClient.CertmanagerV1().Certificates(crt.Namespace).Update(ctx, crt, metav1.UpdateOptions{})
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    c.recorder.Eventf(ing, corev1.EventTypeNormal, "UpdateCertificate", "Successfully updated Certificate %q", crt.Name)
}
```

### Code example 5

HAProxy, written in C, is an example of codebase where comments are not only useful, but also interesting to read. For example, the [freq_ctr.h](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/530408f976e5fe2f2f2b4b733b39da36770b566f/include/proto/freq_ctr.h#L138-L248) file has an extraordinarily well-written comment that details how and why some statistics are computed:

```c
/* While the functions above report average event counts per period, we are
 * also interested in average values per event. For this we use a different
 * method. The principle is to rely on a long tail which sums the new value
 * with a fraction of the previous value, resulting in a sliding window of
 * infinite length depending on the precision we're interested in.
 *
 * The idea is that we always keep (N-1)/N of the sum and add the new sampled
 * value. The sum over N values can be computed with a simple program for a
 * constant value 1 at each iteration :
 *
 *     N
 *   ,---
 *    \       N - 1              e - 1
 *     >  ( --------- )^x ~= N * -----
 *    /         N                  e
 *   '---
 *   x = 1
 *
 * Note: I'm not sure how to demonstrate this but at least this is easily
 * verified with a simple program, the sum equals N * 0.632120 for any N
 * moderately large (tens to hundreds).
 *
 * Inserting a constant sample value V here simply results in :
 *
 *    sum = V * N * (e - 1) / e
 *
 * But we don't want to integrate over a small period, but infinitely. Let's
 * cut the infinity in P periods of N values. Each period M is exactly the same
 * as period M-1 with a factor of ((N-1)/N)^N applied. A test shows that given a
 * large N :
 *
 *      N - 1           1
 *   ( ------- )^N ~=  ---
 *        N             e
 *
 * Our sum is now a sum of each factor times  :
 *
 *    N*P                                     P
 *   ,---                                   ,---
 *    \         N - 1               e - 1    \     1
 *     >  v ( --------- )^x ~= VN * -----  *  >   ---
 *    /           N                   e      /    e^x
 *   '---                                   '---
 *   x = 1                                  x = 0
 *
 * For P "large enough", in tests we get this :
 *
 *    P
 *  ,---
 *   \     1        e
 *    >   --- ~=  -----
 *   /    e^x     e - 1
 *  '---
 *  x = 0
 *
 * This simplifies the sum above :
 *
 *    N*P
 *   ,---
 *    \         N - 1
 *     >  v ( --------- )^x = VN
 *    /           N
 *   '---
 *   x = 1
 *
 * So basically by summing values and applying the last result an (N-1)/N factor
 * we just get N times the values over the long term, so we can recover the
 * constant value V by dividing by N. In order to limit the impact of integer
 * overflows, we'll use this equivalence which saves us one multiply :
 *
 *               N - 1                   1             x0
 *    x1 = x0 * -------   =  x0 * ( 1 - --- )  = x0 - ----
 *                 N                     N              N
 *
 * And given that x0 is discrete here we'll have to saturate the values before
 * performing the divide, so the value insertion will become :
 *
 *               x0 + N - 1
 *    x1 = x0 - ------------
 *                    N
 *
 * A value added at the entry of the sliding window of N values will thus be
 * reduced to 1/e or 36.7% after N terms have been added. After a second batch,
 * it will only be 1/e^2, or 13.5%, and so on. So practically speaking, each
 * old period of N values represents only a quickly fading ratio of the global
 * sum :
 *
 *   period    ratio
 *     1       36.7%
 *     2       13.5%
 *     3       4.98%
 *     4       1.83%
 *     5       0.67%
 *     6       0.25%
 *     7       0.09%
 *     8       0.033%
 *     9       0.012%
 *    10       0.0045%
 *
 * So after 10N samples, the initial value has already faded out by a factor of
 * 22026, which is quite fast. If the sliding window is 1024 samples wide, it
 * means that a sample will only count for 1/22k of its initial value after 10k
 * samples went after it, which results in half of the value it would represent
 * using an arithmetic mean. The benefit of this method is that it's very cheap
 * in terms of computations when N is a power of two. This is very well suited
 * to record response times as large values will fade out faster than with an
 * arithmetic mean and will depend on sample count and not time.
 *
 * Demonstrating all the above assumptions with maths instead of a program is
 * left as an exercise for the reader.

```

I think we all enjoy reading this type of great comments, and that well commented code is an art.

### Other examples

Some projects like HAProxy, Git or the Linux kernel have done an amazing job at keeping knowledge accessible as opposed to knowledge locked in and scattered across many brains. Take a look at these other examples:

- [`ebtree/ebtree.h`](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/530408f976e5fe2f2f2b4b733b39da36770b566f/ebtree/ebtree.h#L23) (HAProxy)
- [`unpack-trees.c`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/2d2118b814c11f509e1aa76cb07110f7231668dc/unpack-trees.c#L821-L836) (Git)
- [`kernel/sched/core.c`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/bfdc6d91a25f4545bcd1b12e3219af4838142ef1/kernel/sched/core.c#L157-L171) (Linux kernel).

Absolute delights.

## Discussion

Bill Kennedy [shared](https://changelog.com/gotime/172) the importance of making a concious effort towards having a common set of values that help a team write good software. Like anything, the team probably needs to find their own set of values, but the two values that Bill talked about in the Gotime episode seem valuable to me:

1. Be precise. Letting uncertainty and inprecision creep into variable names, function names and package mames greatly decreases the chance for someone to understand the concepts captured by your code.
2. Donât make things easy to do; instead, make things easy to understand. That's an other
3. Early use of abstractions and other sorts of indirection hurt.

In my mind, being precise also applies to comments. Precision in comments avoid the reader having to wonder "is that what they really meant?". I think that the values and ideas contained in a design philosophy not only apply to code, but also to comments.

### Good naming takes time

Finding a good name that properly carries the exact intent and help self-documenting takes time. It always takes a few iterations before the code becomes self-documenting enough to be able to remove comments.

![Number of comments lowers with time](chart-comments-over-time.svg)

As shown by the diagram, the amount of comments for a given codebase decreases thanks to PR reviews and refactorings. The more we learn and understand our codebase, the better we become at self-documenting.

### Comments are disposable, don't copy them over

Now, let's talk about the issue of comments becoming outdated. Over time, comments start lying. That's where my second point comes into play: deleting and rewriting comments is part of our job. I would even say that it takes around 40% of my time spent coding.

During code reviews, I pay extra attention to these comments. And yes, very often, comments don't make sense anymore because of some copy-paste of code. We must delete any copy-pasted comment and rewrite it. Spreading copy-pasted comments that we don't really know why they were added in the first place is a plague.

## Conclusion

As a final word, I want us to remember that yes, maintaining comments is a pain. Comments will eventually start lying if you don't delete and rewrite them. But would you rather have no comments at all and let the amount of tribal knowledge creep in every part of your codebase, making it harder and harder for new engineers to join the team?
