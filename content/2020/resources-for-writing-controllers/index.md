I use interchangeably the term "sync loop" and "controller". The word
"controller" is quite overloaded: we use to qualify the binary that runs in
a pod and watches for objects ("Kubernetes controller"), but we also use it
to mean "one sync loop" that is running inside this binary.

Anyone writing Kubernetes controllers might want to take a look at the
following resources.
One controller
