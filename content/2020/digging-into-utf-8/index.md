Not sure if this addresses your issue, but symbol characters (https://copychar.cc/symbols/) are useful where emojis aren't always compatible, and will match your color:
- âœ“
- âœ—

that's an excellent point, âœ— and âœ“ (which are UTF-8 "symbols" as opposed to "emojis") can be displayed in pretty much all the fonts

What I could do:
- red color + `âœ—` (âœ— = U+2717 : BALLOT X, I looked it up [here](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/whatisit.html))
- green color + `âœ“` (âœ“ = U+2713 = CHECK MARK)

But since today's terminal emulators all support UTF-8 emojis, I prefer keeping my emojis ðŸ˜…

Using the macOS "emoji picker" (âŒƒâŒ˜+space), I realized that Unicode and UTF-8
are different. For example, searching for "space" would yield:

|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| NO-BREAK SPACE | Unicode: U+00A0 | UTF-8: C2 A0    |
| EN SPACE       | Unicode: U+2002 | UTF-8: E2 80 82 |
| EM SPACE       | Unicode: U+2003 | UTF-8: E2 80 83 |

What is `U+XXXX`?? And what is `C2 A0`??

And why does the author of [this stackoverflow question][em-space] say that EM
SPACE is "8195 in UTF-8" since UTF-8 is usually given in hexadecimal format?
