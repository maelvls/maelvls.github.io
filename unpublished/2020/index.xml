      Kubernetes&#39; extensibility is probably its biggest strength. Controllers and
CRDs are all over the place. But finding the right information to begin
writing a controller isn&#39;t easy due to the sheer amount of tribal knowledge
scattered everywhere. Here are some links to help you start.

      <title>How do packets find their way back?</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/how-do-packets-come-back/</link>

      <description>
      
      In one of my previous posts, I studied how traffic flows when using
Kubernetes Services. While drawing the last diagram, I did not clearly
see how traffic could make its way back to the user. In this
post, I focus on how packets find their way back and what makes stateless
rewritting interesting.

      <title>Migrating from GKE to Civo&#39;s K3s</title>

      My free trial on GKE was ending in 2 days and I had to find a way to migrate away. I decided to switch to Civo&#39;s managed K3s.

      <title>The Packet&#39;s-Eye View of a Kubernetes Service</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/packets-eye-kubernetes-service/</link>

      <description>
      
      The Service and Ingress respectively brings L4 and L7 traffics to your
pods. In this article, I focus on how traffic flows in and what are the
interactions between the ingress controller and the &#34;service-lb controller&#34;
(the thing that creates the external load balancer). I also detail how the
`hostPort` approach shapes traffic.

      <title>You should write comments</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/you-should-write-comments/</link>

      <guid>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/you-should-write-comments/</guid>
      <description>
      
      We often talk about avoiding unecessary comments that needlessly paraphrase
what the code does. In this article, I gathered some thoughts about why
writing comments is as important as writing the code itself.

      <title>Debugging Kubernetes Networking: my kube-dns is not working!</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/debugging-kubernetes-networking/</link>

      <description>
      
      Some pods were unable to connect to the kube-proxy pod on one of my GKE
Kubernetes clusters. This post present an in-depth investigation using
tcpdump, wireshark and iptables tracing.

      <title>Avoid GKE&#39;s expensive load balancer by using hostPort</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/avoid-gke-lb-with-hostport/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/avoid-gke-lb-with-hostport/</guid>
      <description>
      
      I want to avoid using the expensive Google Network Load Balancer and
instead do the load balancing in-cluster using akrobateo, which
acts as a LoadBalancer controller.

      <title>What to do when Go ignores HTTP_PROXY for 127.0.0.1</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/go-ignores-proxy-localhost/</link>

      <guid>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/go-ignores-proxy-localhost/</guid>
      <description>
      
      At some point, the Go team chose to disable the proxy for requests coming
from localhost or 127.0.0.1. This is annoying when debugging services
locally.
