      Kubernetes&#39; extensibility is probably its biggest strength. Controllers and
CRDs are all over the place. But finding the right information to begin
writing a controller isn&#39;t easy due to the sheer amount of tribal knowledge
scattered everywhere. Here are some links to help you start.

      My free trial on GKE was ending in 2 days and I had to find a way to migrate away. I decided to switch to Civo&#39;s managed K3s.

      <title>The Packet&#39;s-Eye View of a Kubernetes Service</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/packets-eye-kubernetes-service/</link>

      The Service and Ingress respectively brings L4 and L7 traffics to your
pods. In this article, I focus on how traffic flows in and what are the
interactions between the ingress controller and the &#34;service-lb&#34; controller
(the things that creates the external load balancer). I also detail how the
&#39;hostPort&#39; approach shapes traffic.

      <title>Debugging Kubernetes Networking: my kube-dns is not working!</title>

      Some pods were unable to connect to the kube-proxy pod on one of my GKE
Kubernetes clusters. This post present an in-depth investigation using
tcpdump, wireshark and iptables tracing.

      <title>Avoid GKE&#39;s expensive load balancer by using hostPort</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/avoid-gke-lb-with-hostport/</link>

      I want to avoid using the expensive Google Network Load Balancer and
instead do the load balancing in-cluster using akrobateo, which
acts as a LoadBalancer controller.

      <title>Use of conditions in Kubernetes controllers</title>
      <link>https://maelvls.dev/unpublished/kubernetes-conditions/</link>

      Although progress is being made, Kubernetes controllers and operators
still require prior knowledge about Kubernetes internals. Information on
how to set the status is scattered across comments, issues, PRs and the
Kubernetes code itself. Conditions may be a good solution for your
controller, but for what?
