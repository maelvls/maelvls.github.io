I often hear that comments add noise to the code and that comments never get properly updated.
The solution seems to be to properly self-document code. And I love Go for that; one of the Go proverbs even says:
Clear is better than clever.
It is true that Go favors easy-to-read code rather than smart-but-hard-to-parse code, which really helps keeping the level of comments low.</description></item></channel></rss>
