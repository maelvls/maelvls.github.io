I often hear that comments add noise to the code and that comments never get properly updated.
The solution seems to be to properly self-document code. And I love Go for that; one of the Go proverbs even says:
Clear is better than clever.
It is true that Go favors easy-to-read code rather than smart-but-hard-to-parse code, which really helps keeping the level of comments low.</description></item><item><title>What to do when Go ignores HTTP_PROXY for 127.0.0.1</title><link>https://maelvls.dev/go-ignores-proxy-localhost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maelvls.dev/go-ignores-proxy-localhost/</guid><description>I use Proxyman for inspecting the HTTP and HTTPS traffic coming from applications. For example, you may want to know which API calls are made by docker when running docker search. What I would do is
HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:9090 docker search ubuntu Since Proxyman acts like a proxy listening on 0.0.0.0:9090, I can see and replay all the HTTP calls, similarly to what you would do with the Chrome DevTools.
Note that HTTPS is a bit tricky and requires an additional step on macOS (settings &amp;gt; Proxyman CA &amp;gt; Generate new) but works flawlessly with any Go binary since Go supports HTTPS_PROXY by default.</description></item><item><title>Go Happy Path: the Unindented Line of Sight</title><link>https://maelvls.dev/go-happy-line-of-sight/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maelvls.dev/go-happy-line-of-sight/</guid><description>While perusing how other Kubernetes developers are implementing their own reconciliation loop, I came across an interesting piece of code.
The author decided to use the if-else control flow at its maximum potential: the logic goes as deep as three tabs to the right. We cannot immediately guess which parts are important and which aren&amp;rsquo;t.

Many readmes have that:

What are conditions and how should I implement them in my controller?
In this post, I will explain what &amp;lsquo;status conditions&amp;rsquo; are in Kubernetes and show how they can be used in your own controllers.
