So I went into pod-on-2 (10.24.12.40) and checked that DNS wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. What I did is run
% gcloud compute ssh node-2 % docker run --rm -it --net=container:$(docker ps | grep POD_pod-on-2 | head -1 | cut -f1 -d&amp;#34; &amp;#34;) nicolaka/netshoot % nslookup github.</description></item><item><title>Avoid GKE's expensive load balancer by using hostPort</title><link>https://maelvls.dev/2020/avoid-gke-lb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maelvls.dev/2020/avoid-gke-lb/</guid><description>I like being able to keep my own GKE Kubernetes cluster for experimenting. But I realized that this Network Load Balancer was way too expensive.
What happens is that GKE has a LoadBalancer controller running (I can&amp;rsquo;t see it) and whenever I have a service with type: LoadBalancer, it will create a L4 load balancer that balances 80 and 443 traffic across the nodes. Here is a diagram of my current setup:</description></item><item><title>Use of conditions in Kubernetes controllers</title><link>https://maelvls.dev/2019/kubernetes-conditions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maelvls.dev/2019/kubernetes-conditions/</guid><description>While building a Kubernetes controller using CRDs, I stumbled across &amp;lsquo;conditions&amp;rsquo; in the status field. What are conditions and how should I implement them in my controller?
In this post, I will explain what &amp;lsquo;status conditions&amp;rsquo; are in Kubernetes and show how they can be used in your own controllers.
